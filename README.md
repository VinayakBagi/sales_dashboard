# Sales Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a sales dashboard built with React, using Chart.js for data visualizations. It includes line, bar, and pie charts, key metric cards, and a date range filter for interactive data exploration.

## Chart Library Choice

I chose **Chart.js** because it provides simple yet flexible charting options that are easy to implement and customize. It has good documentation and a variety of chart types to meet the project requirements.

## Data Processing Steps

1. **Data Fetching**: Sales data is fetched from a static JSON file or a mock API.
2. **Data Filtering**: The data is filtered based on the selected date range to provide relevant insights.
3. **Chart Data Preparation**: Data is processed into the formats required by Chart.js, such as arrays of labels and datasets.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the project with `npm start`.
4. Open the application in your browser to view the sales dashboard.

## Features

- **Line Chart**: Shows sales trends over time.
- **Bar Chart**: Displays sales by category.
- **Pie Chart**: Illustrates market share.
- **Key Metric Cards**: Highlights total revenue and new customers.
- **Date Range Filter**: Filters data based on the selected date range.
- **Interactive Elements**: Tooltips and drill-down capabilities for detailed insights.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to build a dynamic and informative sales dashboard using React and Chart.js, with a focus on data visualization, user interactions, and clean design.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
